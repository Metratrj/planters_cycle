## About The Project

Of course there are many boilerplate's out there, but none of them covered our expectations. So we decided to start our own.

Here's why:

- We wanted to adapt rust as backend for the lightweight runtime.
- Choosing NextJS for the frontend because of the huge community and the many things you can achieve with it.
- We wanted something *fast*

### Built With

- [Next](https://nextjs.org)
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)
- [Actix](https://actix.rs)
- [Redis](https://redis.io)
- [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [ShadCn](https://ui.shadcn.com)
